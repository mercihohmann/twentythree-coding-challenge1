# Student Engineer Frontend Challenge - Mercedesz Hohmann

In the src folder, there are two separate folders with the code files for the two parts. To those folders, I put only the most important files that I actually used and modified. I hope it's okay in this way otherwise please let me know!

## Part 1

After running the code I got the following output:

## Part 2

I tested my code with an existing API. I used [PunkApi](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) which can give back different types of beers. I played around with it a little to make it similar to the one at the exercise. I got the following output after I run my code.

After that test phase, I implemented the API of this task in the code.
